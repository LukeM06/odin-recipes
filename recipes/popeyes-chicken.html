        <h2> Fried Chicken from Popeyes</h2>

        <p>
            Popeyes Chicken is a delicacy made by the fast food chain Popeyes. Since it is only made by the fast food chain, you cannot make the food yourself<br>
            and you must purchase it had a local restaurant. To purchase it, you must first acquire money. You can get money by getting a job somewhere and waiting<br>
            your first paycheck. Once you get some money, you can go to your local Popeyes and purchase the chicken.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that you have the chicken, there are different places to enjoy it. You can eat it inside the restaurant, or take it home with you. I prefer eating the chicken<br>
            at home, but the location is up to you. Now that you are ready, you can eat your hard earned Popeyes chicken and enjoy this delicacy.
